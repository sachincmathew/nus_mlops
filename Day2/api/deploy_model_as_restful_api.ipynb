    "#### REST (REpresentational State Transfer) in APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a restaurant (your API) serving data (the food). REST provides a set of guidelines for how to order and receive that data using standard HTTP methods (like placing an order):\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GET:** Retrieve data\n",
    "* **POST:** Create new data\n",
    "* **PUT:** Update existing data\n",
    "* **DELETE:** Remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RESTful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "A RESTful API adheres to these REST principles, making it a well-structured and widely adopted approach for building web APIs. It ensures your API is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client-Server:** Separates data providers (servers) from data consumers (clients). Data engineers design and maintain the server side, while other applications or tools can easily interact with it using the API.\n",
    "* **Stateless:** Each request-response pair is independent, meaning the server doesn't need to remember past interactions for each request. This simplifies data engineering on the server side.\n",
    "* **Standard Interface:** Uses HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and common data formats (like JSON) for clear communication. This standardization makes it easier for other applications (and data engineers!) to understand and use your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example (Data Engineering):**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a data pipeline that pulls data from a database (server). It can use a RESTful API to:\n",
    "- **GET:** Retrieve specific data sets using well-defined endpoints (URLs) with parameters.\n",
    "- **POST:** Send new data entries to the database.\n",
    "- **PUT:** Update existing records in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FastAPI\n",
    "FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7 or newer that are based on standard Python type hints. Type hints in Python allow developers to indicate the expected data types of function arguments and return values, improving code readability and facilitating error checking with tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its key features include:\n",
    "* **Automatic API documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates documentation (using Swagger UI and ReDoc) for your API from your Python code. This feature can be incredibly useful for both development and consumption of your API. No additional configuration is required to enable basic Swagger documentation in FastAPI by default. Access it at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs after running the application. Swagger is an interactive API documentation tool that lets you explore and test APIs visually.\n",
    "* **Type checking and validation**: By leveraging Python type hints, FastAPI provides automatic request validation and type conversions, reducing the amount of boilerplate code for parsing and validating input data.\n",
    "* **Asynchronous support**: FastAPI is designed to be asynchronous from the ground up, which can lead to better performance under load, especially for I/O bound applications. This is a more advanced feature that may not be initially of concern for beginners but is valuable for building scalable applications."

    "* `app`: This is the variable name of the FastAPI application instance within that module. In a FastAPI application, you typically create the app with a line like `app = FastAPI()`. The `app` after the colon refers to this instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uvicorn & FastAPI\n",
    "Uvicorn is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server implementation, written in Python. ASGI is a standard interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for Python. It is designed to provide a standard way to build asynchronous applications in Python and to connect them with web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uvicorn serves as the link between the web and FastAPI, enabling the framework to operate on the web by handling incoming HTTP requests and sending responses. Its asynchronous nature boosts FastAPI's performance, making the duo a powerful toolkit for developing modern web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uvicorn allows FastAPI to run asynchronously, handling multiple requests concurrently. \n",
    "* Uvicorn is lightning fast. It is designed to be efficient and to take advantage of modern CPUs. This complements FastAPI's performance, making the combination of the two an excellent choice for applications requiring high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring Uvicorn for production differs significantly from setting it up for development. In development, convenience features like auto-reload are prioritized, while in production, stability, security, and performance take precedence. \n",
    "* In development, you often run Uvicorn with the --reload flag to automatically restart the server upon changes to the code, enhancing productivity. \n",
    "* For production systems, the automatic reload feature provided by Uvicorn with the `--reload` flag should **not** be used. \n",
    "  * The auto-reload feature is designed for development purposes to increase productivity by automatically restarting the server when code changes are detected. However, in a production environment, this feature could lead to instability and unnecessary downtime, as any change to the codebase would restart the server, potentially interrupting active connections and requests. Auto-reloading introduces overhead because the server needs to monitor file changes constantly. In a production environment, the additional overhead from watching for file changes can detract from the application's performance.\n",
    "  * To configure Uvicorn for production, you should **remove** the `--reload` flag and follow best practices for stability and performance. If you're using Uvicorn directly, simply **omit** the `--reload` option when starting the server: `uvicorn main:app`\n"
